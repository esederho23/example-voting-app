Explanation: 

The back-tier network (172.18.0.1/16) was scanned using "nmap -sn" to discover active hosts.
Six IP addresses in total: 172.18.0.1-172.18.0.6.
Address ...0.1 is the Docker bridge interface, while the remaining belong to backend service containers.

Command used (Front-tier):
sudo nmap -sn 172.19.0.1/16

Output (Front-tier):
Nmap scan report for 172.19.0.2 
Host is up (0.00s latency). 
MAC Address: 32:26:02:3E:A7:C0 (Unknown) 
Nmap scan report for 172.19.0.3 
Host is up (0.00017s latency). 
MAC Address: 52:33:47:05:A6:48 (Unknown) 
Nmap scan report for 172.19.0.1 
Host is up.

SERVICE SCAN RESULTS:

Service and version was identified with "-sS" and "-sV".

Front-tier hosts:
Host 172.19.0.2 was scanned with:
sudo nmap -sS -sV 172.19.0.2

Nmap reported an open HTTP service on port 80 implemented with Node.js Express framework. This host corresponds to the web-facing frontend services of the voting application.

Explanation:
The front-tier network (172.19.0.1/16) was scanned using "nmap -sn" to discover active hosts.
Three IP addresses in total: 172.19.0.1-172.19.0.3.
Address ...0.1 is the Docker bridge interface, while the remaining belong to frontend service containers.

Host 172.19.0.3 was scanned with:
sudo nmap -sS -sV 172.19.0.3

Nmap reported an open HTTP service on port 80 running the Werkzeug development server for Python. This is the web interface of the voting application.

Back-tier hosts:
Host 172.18.0.2 was scanned with:
sudo nmap -sS -sV 172.18.0.2

Nmap found an open PostgreSQL database service on port 5432. This corresponds to the backend database used by the voting application.

Overall, the nmap was able to correctly fingerprint the main services in both frontend and backend networks, identifying web servers in the front-tier, and database in the back-tier network.
