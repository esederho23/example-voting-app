During the back-tier capture on the 172.18.0.0/16 bridge interface, Redis traffic was observed.
Filtering with "tcp.port == 6379" showed RESP protocol packets containing commands such as
"LPOP votes", indicating that the worker service retrieves votes from Redis.

The traffic occurred between internal container IP addresses and was transported over TCP.

For the front-tier network, packets were captured on the host interface while accessing the
voting and results web applications. Filtering with "tcp.port == 8080" showed HTTP requests such
as "GET /favicon.ico" and page resources, along with TCP connection setup and termination.

This traffic represents browser communication with the web-facing containers.
