Based on the captured network traffic, each vote is transmitted with a JSON structure containing a "voter_id" as well as the selected option (a or b). This is used so that the application is able to distinguish different voters and prevent unlimited voting from the same person.

The "voter_id" is presumably generated by the frontend service and stored in the user's browser and then forwarded to backend worker service.

If an attacker were to intercept this, the contents of the vote messages would be visible. The attacker could potentially modify the "voter_id" field, bypassing the "uniqueness checks".

This would compromise the integrity of the voting results, thus enabling vote manipulation, highly inflated vote counts, or targeted votes toward the favoured option.
