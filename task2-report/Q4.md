A scan was executed against a front-tier service using:
sudo nmap -A 172.19.0.2

During the scan, Wireshark showed a high volume of TCP traffic along with HTTP packets, ICMP and DNS. 

The "-A" option enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute, which explains the many observed protocols.

Such scans can be disruptive because they generate many rapid connections and could potentially trigger security monitoring or worsen service performance.
